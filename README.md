# FCC-Responsive-Cat-Photo
FreeCodeCamp - Responsive web Design Path - Cat photo app using only html
Started the FreeCodeCamp front-end course from beginning.
I am planning to add each an every app or webpage we build through throughout the course.
One page will be built in the fcc and other on local using vscode.
